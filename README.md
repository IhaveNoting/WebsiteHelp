In the sweltering heat of a Jakarta afternoon, Rizki trudged home from work, his collared shirt clinging to his back and sweat beading on his brow. As he pushed open the door, he was greeted by the familiar sight of Ardi lounging on the couch, phone in hand.

Ardi's dark hair fell messily across his forehead, his piercing green eyes gleaming up at Rizki as he greeted him with a lazy smile. "Hey, Kiek. Long day?" His voice was like warm honey, smooth and comforting.

Rizki nodded, shrugging off his backpack and heading to the kitchen to grab a cold drink. As he passed Ardi, he caught a whiff of the boy's familiar scent - a mix of freshly washed clothes and something uniquely Ardi that made Rizki's heart skip a beat. He handed Ardi his own drink before flopping down beside him on the couch.

As they sat there in comfortable silence, Rizki found himself reaching out to brush a strand of hair from Ardi's face. His fingers lingered, tracing the shape of Ardi's jaw before dropping away. Ardi looked up, their eyes locking in a silent understanding.

Without a word, Ardi set his drink aside and wrapped an arm around Rizki's shoulders, pulling him close. Rizki relaxed into the embrace, his head fitting perfectly against Ardi's chest as he listened to the steady beat of his heart. The air was heavy with unspoken tension as they sat there, the only sound the hum of the fan and their shared breaths.

Suddenly, Ardi shifted, turning Rizki to face him. His hands cupped Rizki's cheeks, thumbs stroking his soft skin. "You know, Kiek," Ardi murmured, his gaze burning into Rizki's. "I've been thinkingâ€¦"

Rizki's breath hitches as he waits for Ardi to continue, the anticipation building between them like a live wire.
